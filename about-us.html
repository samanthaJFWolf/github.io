          <h3>Tie Dye Sweatpants and Sweatshirts</h3>
          <p>
            In this time of life during quarantine we all deserve to be comfortable and fashionable. That is not always
            easily attainable. When I saw that tie dye sweatpants were all the rage with celebrities I thought OMG with
            my tie dye skills I need to get into this.

          <h3>Tie Dye Tanks, Tees and Dresses</h3>
          <p>
            I had friends and customers request tanks and tees, so I quickly expanded.

          <h3>I am eco friendly when possible</h3>
          <p>
            I like to reduce my waste in the tie dye process by reusing baggies and rubber bands. I try to be as
            conscientious as possible because I love our earth. For every 10 items I sell I will plant a fern that
            turns a lot of pollutants in the air into oxygen.
